# Introduction of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Some Applications using Python

## Introduction

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a platform for scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets, for academic, non-profit, business and government users. There are lots of satellite data and geo spatial data gathered every day. Those data are not used by many people due to large size and complicated nature of satellite data. GEE provides online platform that can be used to access, visualize, analyze those data within google cloud.

This tutorial includes introduction to Google Earth Engine (GEE) with wide-range of applications of GEE. We are using Python Programing language for this tutorial. It's recommended to use Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) for these tutorials.
